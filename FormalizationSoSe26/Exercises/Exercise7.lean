section morphisms
/-
We saw in the previous exercise how to define ordered commutative monoids.
We now want to look at morphisms thereof.

Let's get started with the definition of an order-preserving function.
-/
@[ext]
structure OrderPresHom (α β : Type*) [LE α] [LE β] where
  toFun : α → β
  le_of_le : ∀ a a', a ≤ a' → toFun a ≤ toFun a'

/-
Now, it's your turn.
Define a `structure`:
- It is called `OrderPresMonoidHom`.
- It takes two types `M` and `N` in `Type*` as input.
- It extends `MonoidHom₁` and `OrderPresHom`.
- It should admit the `ext` tactic.

Hint: This requires `M` and `N` having instances of `Monoid` and `LE`.

As we saw in the lecture, we generalize from here and define a more general class.
Concretely, we want to define a class `OrderPresHomClass`.
- The input is `F` in `Type*`, `X Y` in  `outParam Type*`.
- `X` and `Y` have instances of `LE`.

It has two fields:
- `toFun : F → X → Y`
- `le_of_le : ∀ f x x', x ≤ x' → toFun f x ≤ toFun f x'`

/-
The following are optional, but are useful exercises:
(1) Define an `instance` of `CoeFun F (fun _ ↦ M → N)`
    - It should be defined as `OrderPresHomClass.toFun`.
    - The assumption should include an instance of `OrderPresHomClass F M N`.
    - Can you use that to determine what other types and instances are necessary?
(2) Also, define an `attribute [coe]` for `OrderPresHomClass.toFun`
(3) For two types `X` and `Y` define an `instance` in
    `OrderPresHomClass (OrderPresHom X Y) X Y`.
    - This requires specifying the `toFun` and `le_of_le` fields.
    - What instances and types do we need for this instance to work?

The next exercise is really necessary:
Define a class `OrderPresMonoidHomClass`.
- The input is `F` in `Type*`, `M` and `N` in `outParam Type*`.
- It extends `MonoidHomClass₂ F M N` and `OrderPresHomClass F M N`.

Hint: Think about which `instance` you need to assume for `M` and `N`.

/-
We need examples.
Define an `instance` in
`OrderPresMonoidHomClass (OrderPresMonoidHom M N) M N`, for types `M`, `N` in `Type*`

Hint: In order for this definition work, which `instance` must `M` and `N` have?
-/

/-
We have now established enough background definitions to state and prove a lemma.

Here, we use the `IsOrderedMonoid` class, which `extends` the classes:
- `PartialOrder`
- `Monoid`
- and additionally includes `IsOrderedMonoid.mul_le_mul_right`
(it resembles `OrderedCommMonoid₁` from `Exercise6`).
-/
#check IsOrderedMonoid
/-
Now, state and prove the lemma `le_of_le_sum`.
The assumptions are:
- `M`, `N`, `F` are types in `Type*`.
- `M` and `N` must have `instance` of `IsOrderedMonoid`.
-  There is `f` in `F`, `m₁` `m₂` `m'₁` in `M` and `h` in `m₁ ≤ m'₁`
- The lemma is of type `f m₁ * f m₂ ≤ f m'₁ * f m₂`.

Hint 1: Which additional `instance` must `M` and `N` have so that the definition makes sense?

Hint 2: In the proof you can benefit from the following:
-/
#check MonoidHomClass₂.map_mul
#check IsOrderedMonoid.mul_le_mul_left
-- You can uncomment the next line after you have defined `OrderPresHomClass`
-- #check OrderPresHomClass.le_of_le

/- DELETE THIS FILL ANSWER HERE-/

/-
Now, use the lemma to prove an example.
The assumptions are:
- `M`, `N` are types in `Type*`.
- `f` is of type `OrderPresMonoidHom M N`
-  There is `m₁` `m₂` `m'₁` in `M` and `h` in `m₁ ≤ m'₁`
- The example is of type `f m₁ * f m₂ ≤ f m'₁ * f m₂`.

section subgroups
/-
In the lecture we saw how to define submonoids and construct
their intersection.

In this exercise we want to repeat the same exercise with subgroups.
-/

/-
Define the structure `Subgroup₁` that represents a subgroup of a group `G`.
- The input is `G : Type*` and `[Group G]`.
- It should admit the `ext` tactic.
- It should have the following fields:
  - `carrier : Set G` representing the carrier of the subgroup.
  - `mul_mem {a b}`: a proof that if `a` and `b` are in the carrier,
    then their product is also in the carrier.
  - `one_mem`: a proof that the unit element of the group is in the carrier.
  - `inv_mem {a}`: a proof that if `a` is in the carrier, then its inverse is also in the carrier.
-/

/- DELETE THIS FILL ANSWER HERE-/

/-
Next define and `instance`
- The input is `G : Type*` and `[Group G]`.
- It takes value in `SetLike (Subgroup₁ G) G`

This proves that subgroups in `G` can be seen as sets in `G`.

If you have defined the `structure` named `Subgroup₁`
and an `instance` of `SetLike (Subgroup₁ G) G`, then
uncomment the next two lines and fill in the `sorry`.
-/

-- instance {G : Type*} [Group G] : Min (Subgroup₁ G) :=
  -- ⟨fun S₁ S₂ ↦ sorry⟩

/-
To apply the instance, define an `example`.
- The input is `G : Type*` and `[Group G]`, `(H K : Subgroup₁ G)`.
- It should be an expression of type `Subgroup₁ G`.
- It should be the intersection of `H` and `K`, constructed above.

section quotient

In this section we want to construct quotients of commutative monoids.

Fill out the `sorry` you find below, to complete the proof.
Use the parts that have been solved as a guide how you can approach the rest.
